    <h2>Storm</h2>
    <p>The storm in Othello is doing way more than just bad weather logistics for the Turkish fleet – it’s Shakespeare’s way of clearing the chessboard and setting up a pressure cooker. By destroying the Turkish threat offstage, the storm removes the external conflict of war and leaves the characters with nothing to fight but each other. Cyprus becomes a kind of emotional laboratory: no political distractions, no big public duties – just Othello, Desdemona, Iago and co. locked together on a vulnerable island. The danger shifts from outward, military threat to inward, psychological threat, which is exactly the territory Iago specialises in.</p>
    <p>The storm also works as a big symbolic mood-setter. It’s chaotic, violent and unpredictable – basically a weather forecast for Othello’s mind later in the play. The turbulence at sea mirrors the emotional upheaval Iago is about to engineer: jealousy, suspicion and rage. When the storm ends and everyone arrives safely in Cyprus, there’s a deceptive sense of relief and celebration – “the war is over, we’re safe”. Dramatically, that false calm makes what follows feel even harsher, because the real “storm” hasn’t actually started yet; it’s just moved inside Othello’s head.</p>
    <p>Finally, the storm helps to isolate Othello physically and socially. Venice is a stable, ordered, political world; Cyprus is exposed, marginal, closer to the frontier. Once Othello is cut off from Venetian structures – the Duke, the Senate, public scrutiny – he becomes easier for Iago to manipulate. The storm literally washes him up in a place where Iago’s voice can dominate and alternative perspectives are limited. So the storm isn’t random stage dressing; it’s a structural device that removes the old rules, foreshadows the emotional violence to come, and strands Othello in the perfect conditions for tragedy.</p>

    <h2>Willow Song</h2>
    <p>Among all the symbols in Othello, the Willow Song is the most dramatic one. It tells the sad story of a woman who died because of fierce love and her man’s disloyalty. Thus, the song reflects the heartache and betrayal.

The readers first hear the song from Desdemona in act 4, scene 3. The woman knows it from her mother’s maid – Barbara. She was suffering from tough love and ultimately died singing the Willow Song.</p>
<p>In the play, Desdemona sings this song while changing the bedsheets. Feeling how cold and rude Othello has become, she decides to provoke the old emotions. She changes the regular sheets to the wedding ones. Desdemona believes that it will remind Othello of their love and strengthen their marriage. Here is where the readers can trace the symbolism of the wedding sheets in Othello.

A terrible sense of foreboding makes Desdemona song the Willow Song. In the play, Desdemona’s song functions as foreshadowing. It presages a tragedy caused by Othello’s cruel jealousy.</p>
<p>Later in the play, Emilia refers to the Willow Song. After revealing the truth about Iago’s villainy, she is stabbed by her husband. So, dying over Desdemona’s deathbed, Emilia sings this song. By doing this, she highlights the destructive nature of jealousy that kills innocent people.Willow Song’s meaning is crucial for the play. It indicates the horrendous fates of Desdemona and Emilia and their husbands’ cruelty.</p>

    <h2>Handkerchief</h2>
    <p>Desdemona‘s handkerchief is one of the most complex Othello symbols. Its uniqueness lies in the diversity of meanings it reflects.
Originally, the handkerchief was made by an old female prophet. According to Othello’s stories, the dye was extracted from the hearts of mummified virgins. Thus, the initial meaning lying behind the handkerchief is virginity and purity.</p>
<p>Othello claims that he got the handkerchief from his mother. She believed that it helps to make the family members faithful to each other. So, from this perspective, the handkerchief represents loyalty and immovable family ties.When Othello got married to Desdemona, he presented the handkerchief to his wife as a love token. Othello believes that while she possesses his present, she is chaste. However, if the woman loses it, she becomes unfaithful. Therefore, in this context, the handkerchief reflects the spouses’ sincere feelings and marital fidelity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with the progress of the storyline, the handkerchief’s meaning loses its high moral value. From the symbol of love and chastity, it turns into a representation of jealousy and disloyalty.

One evening, Othello was complaining about a headache. Trying to relieve the pain, his wife started bandaging his head with the tissue. This act of service represents Desdemona’s care about Othello. The handkerchief appeared on the floor after Othello rudely pushed it away, thinking about his wife’s betrayal. At that moment, Emilia’ takes the tissue. Trying to satisfy Iago, she steals it from Desdemona. Hence, for Emilia, the handkerchief is a symbol of betrayal.

When Othello’s present for Desdemona appears at Iago, the storyline turns in another direction. Through manipulation, Iago transforms the piece of tissue into a powerful weapon. He persuades Othello of Desdemona’s adultery and provides the handkerchief as an “ocular proof.”</p>
<p>Overall, the handkerchief in Othello is the most dominant symbol. Having a multifaceted nature, it symbolizes various things and leads to many deaths.</p>

<div id="cassio" class="charachter-analysis">
    <h2>Animal Imagery</h2>
    <p>Othello’s animal imagery helped underline the differences between the central characters.</p>
    <p>From the first act of the play, Othello is continuously compared to various animals. For instance, telling Brabantio about the marriage, Iago refers to Othello as a “Barbary horse.” In contrast, Desdemona is described as a “beautiful creature.” Moreover, Iago calls Othello “old black ram,” while Desdemona is a “white ewe” (act 1, scene 1). Such a sharp disparity between the spouses is a result of Iago’s crafty word choice.

The comparison of Othello to an animal highlights his outsider status. Having a different skin color, he looks suspicious in the eyes of Venetians. The characters of the play use offensive analogies while describing Othello.</p>
<p>Moreover, the animals can be perceived as the symbols of jealousy in the play. With the progress of the plot, Othello turns into a beast blinded by his resentment. The animalistic nature in Othello peaks in act 4, scene 1. Here, he experiences “epilepsy” as Iago calls it. Being consumed by the feeling of grudge, the Moor loses control. He is unable to act adequately. Instead of behaving like a human-being, Othello demonstrates his inner monster. This case revealed Othello’s true essence – cruel and ruthless.

The last scene of the play also impresses the readers with Othello’s beast-like behavior. Predisposed to numerous rumors, Othello rages at Desdemona more and more. By the end of the play, he desires nothing but revenge. When the Moor sees his wife lying in her bed, his animalistic traits outweigh human ones. He mercilessly strangles Desdemona with the pillow, not realizing his fatal mistake. Thus, the lack of Othello’s human qualities plays a detrimental role in his wife’s fate.

</p>
<p>Othello is not the only person compared to the animals in the play. Iago also faces offensive analogies. For example, when the villain stabs Roderigo, he cries out: “O damn’d Iago! O inhuman dog!” (act 5, scene 1). Thus, he emphasizes Iago’s evil nature. Besides, in the last scene, Lodovico refers to Iago as a snake. Such a metaphor proves his mercilessness and wickedness.

Comparing people with animals in Othello is a powerful tool for exploring personalities. By applying suitable metaphors, Shakespeare lets the readers fully understand each character’s nature.</p>
