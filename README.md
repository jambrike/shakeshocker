shakespeare quotes website
so this is my second midnight project and so i needed something to work on so i can get to go to midnight but i also have really important exams so i was like i guess ill make a study website a absolutely none exist for the othello play for Irish leaving cert english which is similar to a level or ap english in america and there is no total resource for this difficult part of the exam where you have to write a five page essay amd know about 40 quote or so to be safe so this has basically everything you could possibly need and its not on scattered ad filled websites or with a bunch of yap in the middle.

and so this is a bunch of resources from scanned answer from textbook, sparknotes and lists of quotes from mr gpt because there are a lot of quotes to know which is why i made it so you can test yourelf and fill in the blanks to quotes. i think it is a very cool feature.
so hope everything is grand.
